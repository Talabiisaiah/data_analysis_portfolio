I designed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze six months of sales data for a multi-location coffee shop.

The dashboard includes:

Revenue and Transactions Over Time: Monthly trends showing strong revenue growth from February to June.

Peak Hours and Days: Most sales occur between 6–8 am on Thursdays and Fridays.

Product Performance: Coffee and Tea are the top-selling categories, while packaged products contribute minimally.

Store Comparison: Hell’s Kitchen generates the highest revenue (33.84% of total).

Dynamic Slicers: Filters by store location and month for flexible reporting.

This dashboard enables managers to quickly spot sales patterns, optimize staffing, and focus marketing efforts on high-performing products and time periods.

Note: The dataset was provided by my tutor for academic and portfolio development purposes.
